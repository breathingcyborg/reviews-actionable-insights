The dark Knight,Really annoying while connecting it,This is my second sound card I purchased so far. The quality isn't that good and there is a constant humm sound but I got used to it and not noticing it now. I can go with the quality but not with how annoying it is to connect to the laptop. When I connect it with laptop it constantly turns on and off like some milliseconds after and then pc shows that there is a problem with the audio adapter. I have to just plug in and out to make it work and if it doesn't work I have to do it again. If I just move it by mistake the constant on and off starts again.It is very annoying and it isn't much user friendly. The only good thing about this product is that it worked more than 3 months and still working unlike that Quantum usb sound card. Basically a kam chalau product if your laptop's 3.5mm slot is not working.,2.0,5.0,2020-07-20

If I don't attach any pendrive or speaker cable then also it keeps on loosing the connection and if I plug pendrive and it will not work at all. So I put return request for this product. But then it came in my mind that I had same usb cable of my HP printer. I used that cable and boom.. Everything was working properly. All devices pendrive, speaker, Bluetooth dongle connected at once and all was working fine.

Siddharth Mehta,Avoid The Mistake I did,"This product can be a disaster or a boon depending upon how much you want to spend. I bought mine thinking oh wow a USB Hub and DAC in one and instantly regretted once I got it. The packing is shady and cheap and about the voucher winning pamphlet they send with is completely useless as you won't be able to write a good review. So here's mine.Pros:1. I've used a DAC for about the same price, it had better volume controls and worked for 5 years, this one throws a decent audio but you can't see the decrease in volume if you lower windows volume down. It's all the same.2. You can connect basic USB equipments such as bluetooth dongles and wifi dongles here but soon as you connect a hard drive, the power cuts off as it's not able to handle it.3. For the price you can get your audio working in simple plug and play.Cons:1. Really bad packaging, like if I got a half eaten apple thrown at me, I would still accept it than this, comes in a stupid small box with a cable and a pamphlet to win their vouchers writing a good review.2. The audio quality is sub-par seeing they use a printer port connection which should convincingly deliver more power but it doesn't.3. Don't try plugging in an external Hard Drive, you're better off using the main ports on the back of your computer. It cuts off and it won't start back unless you plug out and plug back in.4. Buy an individual DAC/Sound Card and a HUB from a good brand, which is what I did next, unless you're really willing to save like every single rupee which nobody is in these days, you can go with these.Honestly just go buy something else. This will hurt your ears. Save up and buy some USB Powered Headphones that do the same job. I had to use this for work cus it's an absolute necessity.",1.0,5.0,2020-05-23
