Dhruv Gupta,Okayish... Nothing great!!,"I have been consuming wild organic honeys for some years now. Used to buy them from known local and reliable sources. Such pure honeys have certain signature smell, taste and add depth to the drink (geen tea for me) .This Indigenous honey seems like a blend (bcuz they procure from various locations). Though it may be pure but it tastes more or less like other cheaper honeys (tastes less sugary than others but still sugary). You'll have to spend a bit more to get better honeys. I would recommend, based on my experience1) honey and spice -> either wild honey or kashmiri one (both cost ₹540)2) kudrati organics wild honey ( ₹600 )",2.0,5.0,2021-10-23

Kiran,Tastes weird,"I bought this in July after going through many reviews , question answers, ratings. I thought I wont write this feedback, but as it's related to health, am just mentioning this here.I dont know how people are testing ( with hot water, nail drop etc etc ). What I checked is just the taste and it's very bitter and odd. Even that was fine, when I checked their bunch of certificates and authenticity claim. What I felt after consuming is important here. Due to the weird taste, I got vomiting sensation. And it didn't happen one time. Every time I try to take it with whichever method, it just makes you feel odd. May be too much of china sugar or due to the jiggery  ( as some review suggested :-) ) .. I don't know why but it doesn't give you a feel of satisfaction of consuming a good quality raw organic honey. Sorry to the sellers as your claims are thrashed as I also liked the packing, bottle, certificate claim papers & label quality .. but can't ignore the weird sensation in Taste :-( ... Now it's upto the individuals to take a informed call.",1.0,5.0,2021-08-09

Honey can be made by giving the honey bees sugar syrup instead of nectar from flowers and that too will look genuine ... But that is the taste most people are really used to ... And that is why the critic reviews are all about taste and other stuffs like tests and all ...I'm from Kerala and I have friends in the forest areas of Kerala..

PADMAKAR RAO MANTHA,Pure and tasty raw honey for good health,"While searching for honey in the Amazon website, I noticed Indegenous raw honey and read all reviews and noticed that this honey got good ratings. Nowadays getting unadulterated products is not an easy task because everything is adulterated. Somehow, I want to make a try and purchased this honey. It has come in good packing to protect the glass bottle. It's not exeggaration that the Honey is the BEST and pure and no sugars added. The taste is very good and the same is value for money spent on it. I subscribed and save the product so that I will get the item 10% less than the selling price and rest assuredd that every month Among will deliver the honey without fail. This is a good honey and I recommend my fellow Customers to make a try and I am sure you will not repent for your choice. Good luck to the seller. Keep it up.",5.0,5.0,2021-06-01

I will definitely recommend this brand for everyone.This is the second time I have bought this honey brand..and this time the honey just appears like frozen sugar .. this picture is during the month of May..when the temperature is well above 30 degree..still it remains frozen..hence this particular bottle I got must be fake or bad in quality .. I want Amazon and the company to take a note of this and inspect my order.. whosoever is at fault must be reprimanded.. stop playing with lives of people stop selling fake food products,5.0,5.0,2021-05-27
